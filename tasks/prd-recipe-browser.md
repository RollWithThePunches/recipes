# Product Requirements Document: Recipe Browser App

## Introduction/Overview

The Recipe Browser App is a cooking application designed to help users learn new cooking techniques through step-by-step recipe guidance. The primary problem this feature solves is enabling users to discover and follow recipes in a structured way that promotes cooking skill development. The app focuses on browsing recipes by cuisine and category while providing clear, actionable cooking instructions.

**Goal:** Create an intuitive recipe browsing experience that helps users learn cooking techniques through well-organized, step-by-step recipe instructions.

## Goals

1. Enable users to easily browse and discover recipes organized by cuisine and category
2. Provide clear, step-by-step cooking instructions that facilitate learning
3. Offer multiple search and filtering options for recipe discovery
4. Create a simple, user-friendly interface focused on recipe viewing and browsing
5. Establish a foundation for future feature expansion

## User Stories

1. **As a beginner cook**, I want to browse recipes by cuisine type so that I can explore different cooking styles and expand my culinary knowledge.

2. **As a home cook**, I want to see step-by-step cooking instructions so that I can learn proper cooking techniques and follow recipes accurately.

3. **As a meal planner**, I want to search for recipes by typing ingredient names so that I can find dishes that use ingredients I already have.

4. **As a dietary-conscious user**, I want to filter recipes by dietary preferences so that I can find recipes that meet my nutritional needs.

5. **As a busy parent**, I want to browse recipes by meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner) so that I can quickly find appropriate recipes for different times of day.

## Functional Requirements

1. The system must display recipes organized by cuisine categories (e.g., Italian, Mexican, Asian, American, etc.).

2. The system must provide a search function that allows users to type ingredient names to find relevant recipes.

3. The system must display each recipe with the following basic information:
   - Complete ingredients list with quantities
   - Step-by-step cooking instructions
   - Preparation time
   - Cooking time
   - Total time

4. The system must allow users to browse recipes by meal type categories (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, desserts).

5. The system must provide filtering options for dietary preferences (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free, etc.).

6. The system must display recipes in a clean, readable format optimized for following while cooking.

7. The system must provide ingredient category/tag selection as an alternative to typing for recipe discovery.

8. The system must be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile devices.

9. The system must load recipes quickly and provide a smooth browsing experience.

10. The system must display a recipe list view with basic information (title, cuisine type, prep time) before users click into detailed view.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. ~~User account creation and authentication~~ **UPDATED**: Basic authentication is now implemented
2. Recipe favoriting/bookmarking functionality
3. User-generated recipe content or submissions
4. Recipe rating and review system
5. Shopping list generation
6. Nutritional information display
7. Recipe sharing capabilities
8. Video content or cooking tutorials
9. Chef profiles or recipe attribution
10. Advanced meal planning features

## Design Considerations

- **Mobile-First Design:** Prioritize mobile experience since users often cook while holding their phones
- **Large, Clear Typography:** Ensure recipe steps are easily readable while cooking
- **Minimal UI:** Clean interface that doesn't distract from recipe content
- **Category Cards:** Visual browsing experience with cuisine/category cards
- **Search Prominence:** Make search functionality easily discoverable
- **Step-by-Step Layout:** Clear separation between recipe steps for easy following

## Technical Considerations

- Built on Next.js framework (existing project structure)
- Responsive design using CSS/Tailwind
- Static recipe data initially (JSON files or embedded data)
- Search functionality using client-side filtering
- Component-based architecture for recipe cards and detail views
- Consider performance optimization for recipe list rendering
- Plan for future API integration for recipe data

## Authentication and User Experience

### Login Routing System
The application implements a sophisticated login routing system that enhances user experience:

1. **Context-Aware Sign In**: When users click "Sign In" from any page (home, recipe, category, etc.), the system captures their current location
2. **Seamless Return**: After successful authentication, users are automatically redirected back to their original page
3. **Cross-Page Consistency**: The redirect functionality works across all authentication flows:
   - Sign in from header account menu
   - Sign in from mobile drawer navigation
   - Account creation flow
   - Password reset flow
4. **Stay-in-Place Sign Out**: When users sign out, they remain on their current page rather than being redirected to the home page

### Implementation Details
- Uses query parameters (`redirectTo`) to track the original page URL
- URL encoding ensures special characters in page paths are handled correctly
- Fallback to `/account` page if no redirect parameter is provided
- Maintains user context throughout the authentication journey
- Preserves user's browsing position for a seamless experience

### User Flow Examples
- User browsing `/recipe/tacos` → clicks "Sign In" → redirected to `/login?redirectTo=%2Frecipe%2Ftacos` → after login → returns to `/recipe/tacos`
- User on `/category/mexican` → clicks "Sign In" → redirected to `/login?redirectTo=%2Fcategory%2Fmexican` → after login → returns to `/category/mexican`
- User signs out from any page → stays on current page without navigation

## Success Metrics

1. **User Engagement:** Users spend at least 3 minutes browsing recipes per session
2. **Recipe Discoverability:** Users successfully find recipes using search/filter features 90% of the time
3. **Recipe Completion:** Users view complete recipe details (not just browse away from list view) for at least 60% of clicked recipes
4. **Cross-Device Usage:** App functions properly across mobile and desktop devices
5. **Loading Performance:** Recipe pages load within 2 seconds on average
