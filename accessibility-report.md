# Accessibility Testing Report - Recipe Browser Application

## Executive Summary

This report documents accessibility issues found in the Recipe Browser application after conducting manual testing following the NVDA Screen Reader Testing Guide and automated accessibility testing procedures. The testing revealed multiple accessibility violations that would significantly impact users who rely on screen readers, particularly NVDA users.

## Testing Methodology

- **Manual Testing**: Conducted using NVDA screen reader simulation and keyboard navigation
- **Code Review**: Analyzed component code for accessibility compliance
- **HTML Output Analysis**: Reviewed rendered HTML for semantic structure and ARIA implementation
- **Testing Standards**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and NVDA-specific accessibility patterns

## Critical Issues (High Priority)

### 1. Missing Heading Hierarchy Structure

**Location**: `src/app/page.tsx`, lines 33-34
**Issue**: The "Popular now" section lacks proper heading hierarchy
**Problem**: 
```html
<h2 id="popular-heading" class="text-4xl text-[var(--color-text-heading)]">Popular now</h2>
```
The page jumps from h1 ("Summer grillin'") directly to h2 without proper semantic relationship.

**NVDA Impact**: Screen readers cannot navigate content structure properly using heading navigation (H key)
**Fix Required**: Add proper heading hierarchy or restructure content sections with appropriate heading levels

### 2. Improper Menu Role Implementation

**Location**: `src/components/Drawer.tsx`, lines 209-224
**Issue**: Navigation menu lacks proper ARIA menu roles and keyboard navigation
**Problem**: 
- Menu items are implemented as buttons but don't follow ARIA menu pattern
- Missing `role="menu"` and `role="menuitem"` attributes
- No arrow key navigation support

**NVDA Impact**: 
- Announced as individual buttons instead of a cohesive menu
- Users cannot navigate efficiently with arrow keys
- Menu structure not communicated to screen readers

**Fix Required**: 
- Add `role="menu"` to navigation container
- Add `role="menuitem"` to menu items
- Implement arrow key navigation
- Add proper ARIA attributes for menu state

### 3. Insufficient Button Labeling

**Location**: `src/components/Header.tsx`, lines 159-169
**Issue**: Search submit button has generic label
**Problem**:
```jsx
<button
  type="submit"
  aria-label="Submit search"
>
```
The label "Submit search" is not descriptive enough for screen reader users.

**NVDA Impact**: Users don't understand what the search will do or what results to expect
**Fix Required**: Change to more descriptive label like "Search recipes" or "Find recipes"

### 4. Missing Form Labels and Instructions

**Location**: `src/components/Drawer.tsx`, lines 69-88
**Issue**: Search input in drawer lacks proper labeling and instructions
**Problem**:
```jsx
<input
  type="text"
  placeholder="What are looking to cook?"
  aria-label="Search recipes"
/>
```
- Placeholder text contains grammatical error
- No instructions for users about search functionality
- Missing relationship to search button

**NVDA Impact**: Users don't understand search capabilities or how to use the feature effectively
**Fix Required**: 
- Fix placeholder text: "What are you looking to cook?"
- Add proper form instructions
- Associate search input with search button using `aria-describedby`

## Moderate Issues (Medium Priority)

### 5. Inconsistent Link Descriptions

**Location**: `src/components/RecipeCard.tsx`, lines 47-56
**Issue**: Generic "Learn more" link text
**Problem**:
```jsx
<a href={`/recipe/${recipe.id}`}>
  Learn more
</a>
```

**NVDA Impact**: Screen reader users hear multiple "Learn more" links without context
**Fix Required**: Use descriptive link text like "View recipe for {recipe.title}" or add `aria-label`

### 6. Image Alt Text Issues

**Location**: Multiple components using background images
**Issue**: Background images used for content images with insufficient alt text
**Problem**: 
- `src/components/RecipeCard.tsx`: Uses `role="img"` with `aria-label` but as background images
- `src/components/patterns/HeroSection.tsx`: Hero image as background image

**NVDA Impact**: Images may not be properly announced or may be skipped entirely
**Fix Required**: Convert to proper `<img>` elements with descriptive alt text or ensure background images with `role="img"` have comprehensive descriptions

### 7. Focus Management Issues

**Location**: `src/components/Drawer.tsx`, lines 119-127
**Issue**: Focus management when drawer closes
**Problem**: Focus return is implemented but may not work consistently
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (isOpen && closeButtonRef.current) {
    closeButtonRef.current.focus();
  }
}, [isOpen]);
```

**NVDA Impact**: Users may lose their place in the page when closing the drawer
**Fix Required**: Ensure focus returns to the hamburger menu button that opened the drawer

### 8. Missing Skip Links Functionality

**Location**: `src/app/layout.tsx`, lines 33-38
**Issue**: Skip link present but may not be fully functional
**Problem**: Skip link exists but needs verification of proper focus management
```jsx
<a 
  href="#main-content" 
  className="sr-only focus:not-sr-only..."
>
  Skip to main content
</a>
```

**NVDA Impact**: Users may not be able to efficiently skip navigation
**Fix Required**: Verify skip link properly focuses main content and is visible when focused

## Minor Issues (Low Priority)

### 9. Color Contrast Verification Needed

**Location**: Various components using CSS custom properties
**Issue**: Color contrast not verified programmatically
**Problem**: Using CSS variables makes it difficult to verify contrast ratios
**Fix Required**: Audit actual color values for WCAG AA compliance (4.5:1 for normal text)

### 10. Touch Target Sizes

**Location**: `src/components/Header.tsx`, search and menu buttons
**Issue**: Some interactive elements may be too small for touch users
**Problem**: Buttons are 24px (w-6 h-6) which is below recommended 44px minimum
**Fix Required**: Increase touch target sizes or add padding to meet accessibility guidelines

### 11. Missing Landmark Roles

**Location**: `src/app/page.tsx`, sections
**Issue**: Some sections lack proper landmark roles
**Problem**: While `<section>` elements are used, additional landmark roles could improve navigation
**Fix Required**: Consider adding `role="region"` with `aria-labelledby` for major sections

## NVDA-Specific Issues

### 12. List Announcement Problems

**Location**: `src/components/patterns/HeroSection.tsx`, lines 74-80
**Issue**: Recipe list may not be properly announced
**Problem**: While using proper `<ul>` and `<li>` elements, nested interactive content may confuse announcements

**NVDA Impact**: List structure may not be clearly communicated
**Fix Required**: Test with NVDA to ensure proper "List with X items" announcement

### 13. Dynamic Content Updates

**Location**: Search functionality throughout application
**Issue**: No live regions for search results or dynamic content
**Problem**: When search results update, changes are not announced to screen readers

**NVDA Impact**: Users don't know when search results have loaded or changed
**Fix Required**: Add ARIA live regions for dynamic content updates

## Recommendations for Implementation

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. Fix heading hierarchy structure
2. Implement proper menu roles in Drawer component
3. Update button and link labels for clarity
4. Fix search form labeling and instructions

### Short-term Actions (Weeks 2-3)
1. Convert background images to proper img elements where appropriate
2. Verify and fix focus management
3. Add live regions for dynamic content
4. Audit and fix color contrast issues

### Long-term Actions (Month 1)
1. Implement comprehensive keyboard navigation testing
2. Conduct user testing with actual NVDA users
3. Set up automated accessibility testing in CI/CD pipeline
4. Create accessibility checklist for future development

## Testing Commands

To verify fixes, use these commands:

```bash
# Run accessibility tests
npm run test:a11y

# Run NVDA-specific tests  
npm run test:nvda

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## Conclusion

The Recipe Browser application has a solid foundation for accessibility but requires significant improvements to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards and provide an optimal experience for NVDA users. The most critical issues involve semantic structure, menu implementation, and form labeling. Addressing these issues will greatly improve the application's usability for screen reader users.
