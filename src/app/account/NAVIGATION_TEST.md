# Account Navigation Flow Test

## Test Steps

### 1. Initial State (Not Logged In)
- Visit homepage: `http://localhost:3000/`
- Account menu should show "Sign in" button
- Click "Sign in" button
- Should navigate to `/login` page

### 2. Login Process
- On login page: `http://localhost:3000/login`
- Fill in credentials and submit
- Should redirect to `/account` page after successful login

### 3. Logged In State
- On account page: `http://localhost:3000/account`
- Account menu should show logged-in state with:
  - Username "Robin"
  - Menu items: Account, Security, Messages
  - Sign out button

### 4. Account Menu Navigation
- Click "Account" in dropdown → should navigate to `/account`
- Click "Security" in dropdown → should show console log (no page yet)
- Click "Messages" in dropdown → should show console log (no page yet)
- Click "Sign out" → should redirect to homepage and reset login state

## Expected Behavior

✅ **Sign in button** → Navigates to `/login`
✅ **Login success** → Redirects to `/account`
✅ **Account page** → Shows "Welcome Robin!" and logged-in menu
✅ **Account menu items** → Navigate to appropriate pages
✅ **Sign out** → Returns to homepage and resets state

## Current Implementation

- Header component uses `useRouter` for navigation
- Login state is managed locally in Header component
- Account page shows when user is on `/account` route
- All navigation handlers are properly connected
- Responsive design is working correctly
- Design tokens and accessibility features are implemented
